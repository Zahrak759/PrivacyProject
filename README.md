# PrivacyProject
""""
In this project, you will utilize seed based de-anonymization to solve real problems.

In the seed based de-anonymization part, you have two graphs and a seed node pairs file. The graphs are given in edgelist filetype.
seed_G1.edgelist is the original graph and seed_G2.edgelist is the anonymized graph. The file seed_node_pairs.txt gives some matched node seed pairs.  In the file seed_node_pairs.txt the first column refers the node number in graph G1 and the second column refers the node number in graph G2.

As the answer of this problem, you need to give a file shows full mapping of seed nodes in G1 and G2 and follows the format shown in the file seed_node_pairs.txt.

 

Hint:

Example edgelist file format:
# source target

a b

a c

d e


You can use package networkx in python to read the edgelist file.
